# simple_tweet_searcher
A python script to find tweets with hashtags or text.

This is a small script I wrote to learn about twitter API and as a tool for myself to search for recent and relevant research related tweets.

Usage:

* use '--searchfor' to type the tags or text you want to search for. The code prints the tweets to command line. If you want them to be generated as a HTML file then set '--genHTML' to True.

```
python gettweets.py --searchfor #DeepLearning papers
```
